CraftTweaker Recipe Maker
======================

NOTE: This project is still in progress! Many features are missing and/or broken. Build at your own risk.

v2.x Now with support for more than just crafting!

The one and only **CraftTweakerRecipeMaker**! (AKA MTRM2)

This mod creates the .zs file on the server's side, that is why you need the mod on the server too (and need to be op).
(Although you can join a server that does not have the mod, you just won't be able to use it.)

This mod has no relation with MineTweaker/CraftTweaker itself, and MineTweaker/CraftTweaker is not a dependency. Although this mod is utterly useless without it :p

**Warning**, this mod is not idiot proof, but it tries to be. :p Please post bugreports, so we can make it more idiot proof!

How to use
----------

Command: "/mtrm" or "/minetweakerrecipemaker". (New commands will be added to match the name.)

Use tab complete to find out what types are available locally, or use no type to get a list.
